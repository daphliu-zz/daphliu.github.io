Hello there! My name is Daphne and I am a 4th year Computer Science student at University of British Columbia (UBC). I just completed an Android internship at **Shopify**, and previously worked at **Hootsuite**, and **RBC**. During my internships, I've used various languages and tools like **Kotlin**, **Scala**, and **React** for platforms such as **Android** and **Web**.

I have a strong interest in Android development, and just taught my first hands-on Android workshop at Hack the 6ix 2019! I previously published my personal project, Color Breakdown, on [Google Play]((https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tigerxdaphne.colorbreakdown)). 

Last year, I was selected by the **Google CodeU** program to be build a web chat app with a Google engineer mentor. I've also led a team of 7 developers on an **Augmented Reality app** that teaches soil science. It was presented at 3 international conferences, released on app stores, and will be used by 250+ students in UBC classrooms. 

Outside of school, I've won **first place** at a hackathon and spoke at the Microsoft Higher Education Summit about my internship experiences. I've received scholarships such as the BC Tech Scholarship and the IKB Women in Technology Scholarship. I am currently piloting a **coffee chat initiative at UBC** to connect first year students to upper year CS students.

Feel free to reach out to me, let's chat!
