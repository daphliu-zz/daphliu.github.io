I am a proactive and diligent 3rd year Computer Science student at University of British Columbia. I am currently working as a Software Developer intern at RBC. I am interested and worked on a few Android and VR projects. Outside of school, I volunteered to teach girls CS and particpate in hackathons (i was a finalist in two of the three hackathons I attended!) 

I would appreciate opportunities to learn, meet people, and work in different teams. If you would like to chat, feel free to contact me at daphnel.liu97@gmail.com.
