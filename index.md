Hello there! My name is Daphne and I am a 4th year Computer Science student at UBC. I've had 3 Software Development internships at Shopify, Hootsuite, and RBC, using various languages such as Kotlin (Android), Scala, and React. Here are some things about me: 

I have a strong interest in Android development and published my app, Color Breakdown, on Google Play. I've also been mentored through the Google's CodeU mentorship program to build a chat web app. Since last year, I've been leading a team of 7 on an AR app that teaches soil science. It was presented at 3 international conferences and will be used by 250+ students at UBC. 

Outside of school, I am a 2 times hackathons finalist and am currently working on a coffee chat initiative to connect first year CS student to upper year students.

Feel free to reach out to me, let's chat!
