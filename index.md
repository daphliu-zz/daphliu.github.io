Hello there! My name is Daphne and I am a 4th year Computer Science student at University of British Columbia(UBC). I've had Software Development internships at **Shopify**, **Hootsuite**, and **RBC**, using various languages and tools like **Kotlin**, **Scala**, and **React** for platforms such as **Android** and **Web**.

I have a strong interest in Android development and published my personal project, Color Breakdown, on [Google Play]((https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tigerxdaphne.colorbreakdown)). I've built a web app with a Google mentor through the **Google CodeU** mentorship program. I've also led a team of 7 students on an **Augmented Reality app** that teaches soil science. It was presented at 3 international conferences and will be used by 250+ students in UBC classrooms. 

Outside of school, I've won **first place** at a hackathon and spoke at the Microsoft Higher Education Summit about my internship experiences. I've received scholarships such as the BC Tech Scholarship and the Irving K. Barber Women in Technology Scholarship. I am currently piloting a **coffee chat initiative at UBC** to connect first year students to upper year CS students.

Feel free to reach out to me, let's chat!
